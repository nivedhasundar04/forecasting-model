# Time Series Forecasting Model with Prophet

This project involves the implementation of Meta's Prophet, a powerful time series forecasting tool, to accurately predict future trends in the provided data. The model is designed to utilize dates and anomalies effectively, contributing to improved forecasting accuracy and reliability. Notably, this project was submitted to Rutgers Data Science Club's Fall 2023 Datathon and won the award for the most advanced/unique algorithm and code overall.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to forecast time series data accurately using Prophet, taking into account the temporal component as well as any irregularities or anomalies present in the data. By leveraging the capabilities of Prophet, this model aims to provide reliable and insightful predictions for the future time series trends, aiding in informed decision-making and planning.

## Methodology
The forecasting model employs Meta's Prophet, an open-source tool for time series forecasting developed by Facebook. It utilizes an additive model that considers seasonality, trends, and holiday effects, along with the incorporation of custom changepoints and outliers. By carefully handling these components, the model can provide robust and accurate forecasts for various time series datasets.

## Results
The implementation of Prophet in this project has led to highly accurate and reliable forecasts for the provided time series data. The model has successfully captured the underlying patterns and fluctuations, including anomalies, leading to actionable insights for decision-makers. The recognition received at the Rutgers Data Science Club's Fall 2023 Datathon is a testament to the effectiveness and uniqueness of the algorithm and code used in this project.

## Usage
Feel free to use the provided code for time series forecasting using Prophet. You can adapt the code to your specific dataset and requirements. Make sure to install the necessary Python libraries before running the code.

## Future Work
This project serves as a starting point for exploring time series forecasting using advanced techniques like Prophet. Future work could involve the integration of additional features, the exploration of alternative time series models, and the development of a comprehensive framework for automated forecasting and anomaly detection.
